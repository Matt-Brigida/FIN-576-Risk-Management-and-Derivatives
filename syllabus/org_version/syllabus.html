{\bf ACADEMIC HONESTY POLICY}
</p>
</div>
<p>
Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated in this class. Cheating
on quizzes, examinations, and other forms of dishonesty (e.g., plagiarism, collusion, and
falsification of data) will be dealt with in a serious and formal manner. The penalty for academic
dishonesty in this class will be course failure. That is, any student who is found to be cheating
or engaged in other academically dishonest behavior will be failed for this course for this
semester. Course withdrawals to avoid such a failure will not be permitted. As a student, you
have a responsibility to become familiar with the Academic Honesty Policy found in the Student
Rights, Regulations, and Procedures Handbook.<br  />

\end{itemize}
<div class="center">
<p>
<b>EXAMS</b>
</p>
</div>
<p>
There will be two take-home exams (a midterm and a final). The exams will mainly be comprised of short-answer questions, computations, and simple proofs.  More involved questions will be worth more points.  <br  />
\\
<b>Exam Rules</b><br  />
\\
You may discuss the exam with other students.  In fact, such discussions will help you understand the material, and are therefore encouraged.  You must write-up your exam on your own however.  If you simply copy another students' work, you will receive a 0.
</p>
<div class="center">
<p>
<b>DISCUSSION</b>
</p>
</div>
<p>
There will be a discussion board for each two week period.  I'll post the discussion questions/topics by Sunday evening, and you'll have until 2pm on the second following Sunday to post your response.  You are required to make one post per week.  There may be fewer questions than students in the course, so you should feel free to respond to other students' posts.  Just be sure to improve their answer&#x2014;add relevant information or examples.  Don't just write ``Great post!''.

{\bf A Note on Spreadsheet Design:}  You should construct your spreadsheet as if you were an analyst at a company, and you were going to submit the spreadsheet to upper management.  Therefore, getting the correct answer can be considered the minimal amount of work.  The spreadsheet should be easily readable and organized.  There are a couple of reasons why this is important: (1) management often will check some numbers (or maybe change a few inputs if they have more up to date information) and it will reflect very poorly on you if they have to search around through a muddled and ill-conceived spreadsheet; and (2) anyone should be able to pick up your spreadsheet and complete it if you are not there (vacation, sick, or hopefully promoted).  Following are a couple tips on spreadsheet design, though it is far from exhaustive.<br  />
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Hard-code as little as possible.  You want a few cells for your inputs, or a place where you put your data, and then every other cell is linked and feeds off of these input cells. This way, to update your spreadsheet you simply change the inputs or drop in new data.  
</li>
<li>Take the time to label cells, and put in appropriate comments if necessary  - though comments should not be used excessively. Also, it is common to change the cell color depending on whether it is hard-coded (an input) or a formula.  This way you (or anyone else) can immediately look at a cell and tell whether it is one in which you can type (an input).  Don't forget to include a key.
</li>
<li>It is often better to add tabs to a spreadsheet than continue calculations on one tab.  You can easily page through spreadsheet tabs with `Ctrl+Shift' and `Page-up' or `Page-down'.  
</li>
<li>Pivot tables.  While we probably won't need them in this course, you should nonetheless get to know them.  Pivot tables are incredibly useful for summarizing data, and it is very possible you will be asked in an interview whether you are familiar with them.  Similarly, get to know VLOOKUP.
</li>
<li>If you are inputting a long formula, then break the calculation into multiple cells.  This makes it much easier to tell where a mistake was made - and everyone always spends a fair amount of time looking for errors. 
</li>
<li>Excel has many built in formulas which can be useful, however it is important that you understand what the formula is doing to use them.  Blindly applying a formula can lead to trouble.  For example, if you use the IRR() function on cash flows with multiple roots, the formula will return the first root it finds without signaling to you that there are other roots.  Also, there are Excel formulas that are flat out incorrect - in particular the NPV() function.  So, use a function if it saves time, but first be sure you know what the function is doing and verify it works.  That said, in my experience it is better (and faster) to input your own formula instead of using Excel's.  You often have to break the calculation into a couple of steps, but this can be done quickly, and the result is a spreadsheet that you know works and is easily auditable. 
</li>
